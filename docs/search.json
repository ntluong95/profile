Manipulating data frames is one of the most common data science activities, so choosing the right library for it is key.\nMichael Chow, developer of siuba, a Python port of dplyr on top of pandas wrote describes the situation well:\nThe higher-level libraries he mentions come with a problem : There‚Äôs no universal standard.\nIn a discussion of the polars library on Hacker News the user ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù put the dplyr user perspective more bluntly:\nI‚Äôm more willing to compromise though, so here‚Äôs a comparison of the strongest contenders."

A more mature library has a more stable API, better test coverage and there is more help available online, such as on StackOverflow.

For instance, dplyr is more mature than its star count suggests. Comparing the completeness of the documentation and tutorials for dplyr and polars reveals that it‚Äôs a day and night difference.\nWith the quantitative comparison out of the way, here‚Äôs a qualitative comparison of the Python packages. I‚Äôm speaking of my personal opinion of these packages - not a general comparison. My reference is my current use of dplyr in R. When I need more performance, I use tidytable to get most of the speed of data.table with the grammar of dplyr and eager evaluation. Another alternative is dtplyr, which translates dplyr to data.table with lazy evaluation. I also use dbplyr, which translates dplyr to SQL.\nI‚Äôll compare the libraries by running a data transformation pipeline involving import from CSV, mutate, filter, sort, join, group by and summarize. I‚Äôll use the nycflights13 dataset, which is featured in Hadley Wickham‚Äôs R for Data Science."

That has a lower memory footprint, but can‚Äôt be run repeatedly for the same result, such as in interactive use in a notebook.\nHere, the query() function is slightly awkward with the long string argument. The groupby doesn‚Äôt allow renaming on the fly like dplyr, though I don‚Äôt consider that a real drawback. Perhaps it‚Äôs clearer to rename explicitly anyway.\nPandas has the widest API, offering hundreds of functions for every conceivable manipulation. The clip function used here is one such example. One difference to dplyr is that pandas uses its own methods .mean(), rather than using external ones such as base::mean(). That means using custom functions instead carries a performance penalty.\nAs we‚Äôll see later, pandas is the backend for siuba and ibis, which boil down to pandas code.\nOne difference to all other discussed solutions is that pandas uses a row index. Base R also has this with row names, but the tidyverse and tibbles have largely removed them from common use. I never missed row names. At the times I had to work with them in pandas they were more confusing than helpful. The documentation of polars puts it more bluntly:\n\nNo index. They are not needed. Not having them makes things easier. Convince me otherwise\n\nThat‚Äôs quite passive aggressive, but I do agree and wish pandas didn‚Äôt have it."

Once I understood the _ placeholder for a table of data, I could write it almost as fast as dplyr. Out of all the ways to refer to a column in a data frame, I found it to be the most convenient, because it doesn‚Äôt require me to spell out the name of the data frame over and over. While not as elegant as dplyr‚Äôs tidy evaluation (discussed at the end of the article), it avoids the ambivalence in dplyr where it can be unclear whether a name refers to a column or an outside object.\nIt‚Äôs always possible to drop into pandas, such as for the aggregation functions which use the mean() and count() methods of the pandas series. The &gt;&gt; is an easy replacement for the %&gt;% magrittr pipe or |&gt; base pipe in R.\nThe author advertises siuba like this (from the docs):\n\nSiuba is a library for quick, scrappy data analysis in Python.

A big plus is the ability to handle larger than memory data.\nDuckDB can also operate directly on a pandas dataframe. The SQL code is portable to R, C, C++, Java and other programming languages the duckdb has APIs. It‚Äôs also portable when the logic is taken to a DB like Postgres, or Clickhouse, or is ported to an ETL framework like DBT.\nThis stands in contrast to polars and pandas code, which has to be rewritten from scratch. It also means that the skill gained in manipulating SQL translates well to other situations. SQL has been around for more than 50 years - learning SQL is future-proofing a career.\nWhile these are big plusses, duckdb isn‚Äôt so convenient for interactive data exploration. SQL isn‚Äôt as composeable. Composing SQL queries requires many common table expressions (CTEs, WITH x AS (SELECT ...)). Reusing them for other queries is not as easy as with Python. SQL is typically less expressive than Python. It lacks shorthands and it‚Äôs awkward when there are many columns. It‚Äôs also harder to write custom functions in SQL than in R or Python. This is the motivation for using libraries like pandas and dplyr. But SQL can actually do a surprising amount of things, as database expert Haki Benita explained in a detailed article.\nOr in short, from the documentation of ibis:\n\nSQL is widely used and very convenient when writing simple queries. But as the complexity of operations grow, SQL can become very difficult to deal with.\n\nThen, there‚Äôs the issue of how to actually write the SQL code. Writing strings rather than actual Python is awkward and many editors don‚Äôt provide syntax highlighting within the strings (Jetbrains editors like PyCharm and DataSpell do). The other option is writing .sql that have placeholders for parameters. That‚Äôs cleaner and allows using a linter, but is inconvenient for interactive use.\nSQL is inherently lazily executed, because the query planner needs to take the whole query into account before starting computation. This enables performance gains. For interactive use, lazy evaluation is less convenient, because one can‚Äôt see the intermediate results at each step. Speed of iteration is critical: the faster one can iterate, the more hypotheses about the data can be tested.\nThere is a programmatic way to construct queries for duckdb, designed to provide a dbplyr alternative in Python. Unfortunately its documentation is sparse.\nUsing duckdb without pandas doesn‚Äôt seem feasible for exploratory data analysis, because graphing packages like seaborn and plotly expect a pandas data frame or similar as an input."

    "text": "ibis: Lingua franca in Python\nThe goal of ibis is to provide a universal language for working with data frames in Python, regardless of the backend that is used. It‚Äôs tagline is: Write your analytics code once, run in everywhere. This is similar to how dplyr can use SQL as a backend with dbplyr and data.table with dtplyr.\nAmong others, Ibis supports pandas, PostgreSQL and SQLite as backends. Unfortunately duckdb is not an available backend, because the authors of duckdb have decided against building on ibis.\nThe ibis project aims to bridge the gap between the needs of interactive data analysis and the capabilities of SQL, which I have detailed in the previous section on duckdb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUPDATE October 2023\n\nDuckdb is now a supported backend (along with many more). So performance is going to be very similar to duckdb.\nDirectly load/save data\njoin(), clip(), and case() are well-supported\nIbis is much more popular and now very actively maintained. There are more examples, better documentation, and community. Still definitely less than pandas, but perhaps comparable to polars.\n\nThanks to NickCrews for providing this update, including the following code example.\n\n\nFor the test drive, I‚Äôll use the duckdb backend, meaning that the ibis code is translated to duckdb operations, similar to how siuba is translated to pandas.

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIt‚Äôs not a clear-cut choice. None of the options offer a syntax that is as convenient for interactive analysis as dplyr. siuba is the closest to it, but dplyr still has an edge with tidy evaluation, letting users refer to columns in a data frame by their names (colname) directly, without any wrappers. But I‚Äôve also seen it be confusing for newbies to R that mix it up with base R‚Äôs syntax. It‚Äôs also harder to program with, where it‚Äôs necessary to use operators like { } and :=.\nMy appreciation for dplyr (and the closely associated tidyr) grew during this research. Not only is it a widely accepted standard like pandas, it can also be used as a translation layer for backends like SQL databases (including duckdb), data.table, and Spark. All while having the most elegant and flexible syntax available.\nPersonally, I‚Äôll primarily leverage SQL and a OLAP database (such as Clickhouse or Snowflake) running on a server to do the heavy lifting. For steps that are better done locally, I‚Äôll use pandas for maximum compatibility. I find the use of an index inconvenient, but there‚Äôs so much online help available on StackOverflow. Github Copilot also deserves a mention for making it easier to pick up. Other use cases can be very different, so I don‚Äôt mean to say that my way is the best. For instance, if the data is not already on a server, fast local processing with polars may be best.\nMost data science work happens in a team. Choosing a library that all team members are familiar with is critical for collaboration. That is typically SQL, pandas or dplyr. The performance gains from using a less common library like polars have to be weighed against the effort spent learning the syntax as well as the increased likelihood of bugs, when beginners write in a new syntax.\nRelated articles:\n\nPolars: the fastest DataFrame library you‚Äôve never heard of\nWhat would it take to recreate dplyr in python?\nPandas has a hard job (and does it well)\ndplyr in Python?

This section will take you through useful keyboard shortcuts and features for working with data.\n\nUseful Shortcuts\nWhile you don‚Äôt necessarily need to use keyboard shortcuts, they significantly improve developer productivity. The following image illustrates what it takes to run a single cell without keyboard shortcuts:\n‚Äç\nImage 9 ‚Äì Running Jupyter cell without shortcuts Manually clicking on the play button will become pretty annoying after a couple of iterations. Instead, you can opt for one of the following:\nControl + Enter: Run the current cell without creating a new one Shift + Enter: Run the current cell and create a new cell for the same programming language While in a notebook environment, you might also find the following shortcuts useful:\nC: Copy cell X: Cut cell V: Paste cell D: Delete cell Command/Control + P: Navigate between files Note that they are different from the usual jupyter notebook keyboard shortcuts, but you can see the full list of available shortcuts in Settings ‚Äì Keyboard Shortcuts. Every shortcut is adjustable.\n\n\nDataFrame Viewer\nDataframes are the core of all data science workflows, so having an IDE that can display all relevant information about them is a must-have feature.\nPositron allows you to print the dataframe content to the R console by calling R-specific functions, such as head():\n‚Äç\nImage 10 ‚Äì Printing the top 6 rows of a dataframe But the more interesting feature is the dataframe viewer. Once your dataframe is declared, you‚Äôll see it in the Variables panel. You can expand the variable to view all columns and their respective values, or you can click on the table column to inspect the dataframe in an Excel-like fashion:\n‚Äç\nImage 11 ‚Äì Dataframe inspection As you can see, you can sort the values, apply filters, inspect missing values, and much more ‚Äì straight from the GUI.\n\n\nPlot Viewer\nAn amazing feature of RStudio is the plot viewer. You have a dedicated panel for visualizations, and you can easily cycle through multiple charts. Positron has the same feature, arguably with a somewhat updated interface:\n‚Äç\nImage 12 ‚Äì Plot inspection Creating a new chart won‚Äôt delete the old one, as you can easily navigate between them using the right-side panel:\n‚Äç\nImage 13 ‚Äì Plot inspection (2) Up next, let‚Äôs discuss the powerful and improved variable inspector.\n\n\nVariable Inspector\nBeing able to inspect complex objects, such as plots, is an essential feature for debugging code and making sure everything works as expected. RStudio also has this feature, but Positron allows you to dig deeper and has a sleeker-looking user interface:\n‚Äç\nImage 14 ‚Äì Variable inspection As you can see, you can drill down into all the small pieces that are combined to make complex objects."
