### Event description

GlobeLife is hosting a Career Event for Global Health Master‚Äôs students at Uppsala University and Karolinska Institutet. The event aims to connect current students with potential recruiters for internships and postgraduate jobs and give students an opportunity to network! In the run-up to the event, we will be hosting a Careers Workshop hosted by UU Careers to improve your CV and learn how to do strategic networking. This will give you a chance to be as prepared as possible for the actual day! 

On the afternoon of Friday the 30th of May, we would like to invite you to join us at Uppsala Universitet at 16:00. We will start the event with speeches from professionals currently working in the field of Global Health, followed by a form of Careers Fair. You will get the opportunity to walk around, meet and chat with the recruiters. Have your CV on hand to exchange with any recruiters that you think would be interesting to work for. Of course, in true Swedish style, Fika will be provided! 

The event will be a great opportunity to listen to inspiring speakers, grow your network, and potentially land a future internship or job!
