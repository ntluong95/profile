# Description

This workshop is designed to build foundational skills in R, covering everything from importing and cleaning data to transforming it for analysis. It also introduces essential statistical techniques used in environmental epidemiology, including `Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM)`, `Cox regression`, `time series analysis`, and data visualization with `ggplot2`.

# Learning objectives

- Develop proficiency in using R to import, clean, and transform data, ensuring it is analysis-ready.
- Understand and apply common statistical methods in environmental epidemiology, such as DLNM, Cox regression, and time series analysis.
- Master the creation of effective visualizations with ggplot2 to communicate data insights.
- Gain practical experience in preparing and analyzing environmental health data using R.
